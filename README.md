A personal project.  
Asked myself 'What would happen if the Tower of Hanoi had more than three pegs?'  
... A few hours later, this was the result.  
  
Just needs Python3 and the standard libs.  
Usage:  
python3 Tower_Of_Hanoi_Arbitrary.py <# Pegs> <# Blocks> [--debug]  
Eg:  
python3 Tower_Of_Hanoi_Arbitrary.py 6 20 
  
Spits out the start condition, end condition, and the number of moves required to get there.  
Apparently the end result is 217 moves.  
  
Add the --debug flag to see every move taken.
